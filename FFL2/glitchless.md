## Ashura  

Equipment Change: Human F: Remove Rapier. Robot: Equip Rapier (+4 Agility)  

Agility effects accuracy, evasion, the chance to run, and the damage agility-based weapons do. By removing the Rapiers from the Human Fs, you reduce the number of inputs required for each turn. Running away is successful if the random number rolled from 0 to 50 is less than 100 * (5 - # of active party members) + the sum of your party's agility - the sum of the enemy groups' agility As a result, whenever you have a 5th party member, you'll have a drastically reduced chance to run until you build your party's agility high enough to compensate. It's also harder to run away from a battle with 3 groups of enemies than a battle with just one or two though the difference is not as drastic as having a 5th party member.

Cave of North: Save before fighting the BabyWyrm and soft reset or restart the run until you get meat from it.

##Ashura's World Navigating the Desert Head 4 steps to the east from the Pillar of Sky and head straight down into the sandstorm.

## Minion


You can have the Human F #1 attack Odin instead, but it's possible for the Robot to not defeat the Sleipnir in one hit. If the OdinCrows aren't petrified, just leave them alone until Odin is defeated. Their attacks will mostly be blocked by the Tank and Aegis. After the 1st turn, have the Watcher use Beam on Odin. Everyone else does what they did on the 1st turn, except targeting Odin instead. Once Odin is defeated, if the OdinCrows are still around, have the Robot attack them with the Samurai Bow. Meat: Monster #2 can freely eat either Sleipnir or OdinCrow meat at this point. If Sleipnir meat dropped, you'll receive drastically reduced gold. This only matters if you have two Human Fs.

Use the Pegasus Magi to warp to Valhalla Palace to be taken to outside the exit. Continue on to the next world.

##Final World Forest Save (Odin is not around to resurrect you anymore)

vs. Minion Have your 2nd party member use something other than Aegis. This is to setup cursor memory for the next few battles. The Watcher uses StonGaze. (60% chance to hit) If you're unlucky enough when it comes to StonGaze, it is possible for the Robot to take out Minion by itself.

After the battle is over, and the scene plays out, leave to the west and head south to the Final Dungeon.

B10F Equipment Change Robot: Replace a Headbut with Karate. Dad: Equip the Book of Flare and Hecate Boots.

## Apollo


Get the Heart Magi, and head north to the Final Town.

Final Town Weapon Shop Sell everything. Buy a CatClaw, and 3 to 4 Laser Guns. Only 3 Laser Guns are needed for a Human F, Imp party and you can only afford 3 if Sleipnir meat dropped.

A worst case scenario, no extra drops, minimum # of enemies in required battles, and Sleipnir meat dropping, will leave you with exactly 32692 Gold. Buy a Tent, and 4 Elixiers. You'll have to conserve at most 5 uses of Flare in the descent to Arsenal.

Leave and head back to the Forest, and enter the Pillar of Sky there.

Central Shrine Save before confronting Apollo.

vs. Apollo Turns 1 to 5 Anyone that has a Laser Gun equipped uses it. Watcher uses Beam. Monster #2 does whatever is effective or produces the least amount of text each turn. Dad uses Flare.


## TianLung


Turn 6 The Robot switches to attacking with a CatClaw. Apollo will attack with the Masamune. Who Apollo hits with the Masamune determines the course of the next 2 turns.

Turn 7 For a 2 Human F route: If Apollo hit Dad with the Masamune, or if Sleipnir meat dropped, continue attacking, and have the Watcher use Heart Magi. Otherwise, run as you have done enough damage to trigger Apollo's meltdown.

For a Human F, Imp route: Continue attacking with everyone except Dad who now uses the Heal Staff. If the Watcher or Dad got hit by the Masamune, have the Watcher use Heart Magi as well.

Turn 8 Run, as Apollo started melting down last turn.

Once the battle is over talk to Dad, then talk to Isis.

##Descent to Arsenal From this point forward, you cannot run from random encounters, with one small exception. The number of random encounters fought in this area is anywhere from 22 to 23. There's also 2 mini-bosses.

Most encounters can be taken care of with Isis's Flare. Make sure to keep track of how many uses of Flare Isis has left. When she runs out, use an Elixier on her. You'll want to save any Tents you have for last.

There is some chance for Flare's damage to roll low enough to not take out some monsters, so make sure to spread the damage the rest of your party deals evenly. The monsters that tend to survive Flare the most are SS, T-Rexs, Wyrms and Musashis. You'll want to either StonGaze or FatalGas the SS depending on what your primary monster currently is. T-Rexs and Wyrms can be taken care of with a hit from the Samurai Bow in addition to Flare. Musashis just have a large amount of HP so you'll want your whole party doing their most powerful attacks aimed at them.

Your primary monster won't eat any meat from random encounters, but a secondary monster is free to do so.

When you reach the first mini-boss, save. vs. Tian-Lung Reset if there's more than 2 or if your primary monster gets KO'd during the fight. Have your Human Fs fire their Laser Guns. A secondary monster uses its strongest attack. The Watcher uses StonGaze. It won't actually do anything, but Beam won't make an appreciable difference and will play an animation as well. The Robot attacks with the CatClaw. Isis uses Flare. Meat: Have the Watcher eat it to become a Madame.


## Fenrir


Save before the 2nd mini-boss. vs. Fenrir Reset if there's more than 2. Have your Human Fs fire their Laser Guns. A secondary monster uses its strongest attack. Madame uses Absorb. The Robot attacks with the CatClaw. Isis uses Flare. If anything goes wrong during this battle, or if you have a petrified party member, feel free to have Isis use the Heart magi. Meat: Monster #2 eats it. If you don't have a secondary monster, leave it.


## Arsenal


Last Floor Refer to a video above to learn how to navigate through this floor. Musashi are more common on this floor. You can rarely run into Haniwas here. You can run away from them, and should since there's no reason to fight them. Before you fight Arsenal, use a Tent if available, and save.

Equipment Change Only do this if Sleipnir meat dropped, and you're running a 2 Human F party. Human F #2: Unequip the Laser Gun. Robot: Replace a Headbut with a Laser Gun. Alternatively, if a Jyudo or Karate dropped from a Bl.Belt, equip that instead and leave the Laser Gun on the Human F.

Party Sort Swap Human F #1 with the Madame.

vs. Arsenal Phase 1: 4 Cannons (1001 HP each) A hit from a CatClaw should take care of a cannon per turn. The combined damage of Laser Guns from your Human F(s), Madame's Absorb and Monster #2's strongest attack can also take one out. Once all cannons are defeated, Arsenal will move to the Smasher Phase

Phase 2: Smasher (5000 HP) Continue to damage Arsenal. If your secondary monster has a high damage spell with a low usage count, switch to another attack to save some uses for the final phase. Madame should Heal each party member starting with the Robot, and then switch to Absorb to heal itself for the final phase.

Phase 3: Launches Smasher Phase (5000 HP) Human Fs fire their Laser Guns until no longer able to. Switch your secondary monster back to doing its highest damage attack until it's no longer able to. The Robot will always attack with the CatClaw. Madame either uses Absorb or Heal. Use Heal if the Robot is below 400 HP. Use Absorb if Madame is below 400 HP. Prioritize Madame's survival above all.

Launches Smasher deals 99 to 639 damage. The exact formula is 99 + 18 * a random number from 0 to 30, ignoring defense.

##The End After the battle, talk to Isis. Take the elevator you passed by earlier, and go talk to Dad to start the credits.
